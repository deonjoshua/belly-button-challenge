# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore a dataset on Belly Button Biodiversity which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
